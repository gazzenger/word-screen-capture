# word-screen-capture
*Created by Gary Namestnik*
This is a simple VBA script &amp; userform for allowing people to easily capture screenshots and descriptions and place these directly in MS Word as they're performing something

This file is intended to be loaded in the MS Word Template, that way a keyboard shortcut can be associated.

Once this is done, then by opening a new word document, and executing the "Run" macro, the userform will open, ready for perform screenshots.
